SFML GUI Button class example

**special note**
Did not distribute font with the example - it can be found here:

## Addendum 6/15/2021
This tiny project, while written long ago, originally depended on the Thor library for SFML.
You may find support for features out of the box via [the Thor repo](https://github.com/Bromeon/Thor).
However, as this was originally written in 2014, things may have changed in the APIs for either SFML
or Thor. I may or may not update the repo if I find the time to investigate, but this should outline
the issue well enough for anyone curious enough to track down and troubleshoot any errors when building.
